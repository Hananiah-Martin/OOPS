**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples**
Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples repository! This repository contains a collection of code examples, exercises, and projects to help you understand and apply the principles of OOP.


_**
Introduction**_
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). This repository provides practical examples and exercises to help you learn and master OOP concepts.

Concepts Covered
This repository includes examples and projects demonstrating the following OOP concepts:

Classes and Objects: Creating and using classes and objects.
Encapsulation: Hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods.
Polymorphism: Using a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors.
